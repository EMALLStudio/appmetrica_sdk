# Contributing to AppMetrica SDK

## Create a new issue

The easiest way to get involved is to create a [new issue](https://github.com/EMALLStudio/appmetrica_sdk/issues/new) when you spot a bug, if the documentation is incomplete or out of date, or if you identify an implementation problem.

## General coding guidlines

If you'd like to add a feature or fix a bug, we're more than happy to accept pull requests! We only ask a few things:

  - Ensure your code contains no analyzer errors, e.g.
    - Code is strong-mode compliant
    - Code is free of lint errors
  - Format your code with `dartfmt`
  - Write helpful documentation
  - If you would like to make a bigger / fundamental change to the codebase, please file a lightweight example PR / issue.
